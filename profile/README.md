# opensource.finance

**Open-source infrastructure for the next generation of fintech.**

We're building the operating system for financial vigilance — starting with transaction monitoring, now expanding into AI-powered compliance automation.

## 🦅 Osprey

Our flagship project. A single-binary, real-time transaction monitoring engine.

- **60-Second Deploy** — No Kubernetes. No microservices. Just download and run.
- **Secure by Design** — Built with lessons from protecting national payment rails.
- **Open Source** — Apache 2.0. Run it on your infrastructure. Own your data.

> *Transaction monitoring for everyone who isn't a bank.*

## 🤖 Osprey Narrator

**AI-powered SAR narrative generation.** A fine-tuned LLM that transforms Osprey's raw alert output into structured, analyst-ready compliance narratives — replacing hours of manual report writing with seconds of inference.

- **Instant Narratives** — Feed it an Osprey alert JSON, get a complete SAR-style report
- **12 FATF Rules + 6 Typologies** — Full coverage of AML/CFT compliance framework
- **Run Anywhere** — Available as LoRA adapter (HuggingFace) or quantized GGUF (Ollama)
- **Trained on Synthetic Data** — No real customer data used, fully reproducible

> *From alert to narrative in seconds, not hours.*
